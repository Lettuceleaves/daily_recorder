**change the path in the recoder.c file**

sorry for wrong file name, but I'm such a lazy bone ~

**compile two C files then you can record data into the .txt file by recoder.c and update the html page by graph.c, it would create an html file automatically**

It would be convenient to write a script to automate the process of starting.

The aim of the small project is that I want to track my daily code quantity and motivate me to take notes.

recommend that you can set a shortcut key by "AutoHotKey" and ask the friendly ai to generate a .bat file(on Windows) for you. It can make it efficiently.
